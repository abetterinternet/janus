  # Path to a PEM file with root certificates to trust for TLS database

key_rotator:
  # Rotation policy for global HPKE keys. At least one is required. Each entry
  # represents a key with a particular ciphersuite.
  hpke:
    - # How long the key remains pending before it's promoted to active. Should
      # be greater than the global HPKE keypair cache refresh rate. Default to
      # 1 hour.
      pending_duration_secs: 3600

      # The TTL of the key. Defaults to 4 weeks.
      active_duration_secs: 2419200

      # How long the key can be expired before being deleted. Should be greater
      # than how long clients cache HPKE keys. Defaults to 1 week.

      # The algorithms used by the key. Must be unique across different entries

      # Safely phase out this config.
      #
      # If set, on next run the key rotator will immediately delete any pending
      # keys and expire any keys with the given ciphersuite. Expired keys are
      # retained for `expired_duration_secs` before being deleted.
      #
      # After the key rotator has run after `expired_duration_secs`, this config
      # entry can be removed entirely. You should not remove this config unless
      # the key rotator has been run after `expired_duration_secs` with
      # `retire: true`.
      #
      # There must be at least one non-retired config present with its key
      # in the active state (i.e. the key rotator has been run for longer
      # than `pending_duration_secs` with a new key config). If this is the
      # only key and it is marked retired, the key rotator will refuse to run.
      #
      # Defaults to false.
